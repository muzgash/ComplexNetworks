ComplexNetworks
===============

This is a repo with the code made while studying complex networks and evolutionary
game theory to begin with my work to aquire the degree of physicist.

To compile with cmake just run:
* $ mkdir build; cd build
* $ cmake ..;make

Then run the Watts-Strogatz model with

* $ ./was

Or the Barabasi-Albert model with

* $ ./ba

With the right arguments...
