ComplexNetworks
===============

This is a repo with the code made while studying complex networks and evolutionary
game theory to begin with my work to aquire the degree of physicist.

To compile with cmake just run:
* $ mkdir build; cd build
* $ cmake ..;make
Then run the Watts-Strogatz model with
* $ ./was
Or the Barabasi-Albert model with
* $ ./ba
With the right arguments...
