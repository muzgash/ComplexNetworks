ComplexNetworks
===============

To compile with cmake just run:
* $ mkdir build; cd build
* $ cmake ..;make

Then run
* ./synergy

The code is made for creating by default a small network with the Barabasi-Albert model
You can explore the file src/synergy.cpp to change the parameters and the model.

This is intended for a further development of a model of synergy in a SIS model on complex networks.
